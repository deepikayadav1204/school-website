CM Shri School - Multi-page React Site (scaffold)
------------------------------------------------
This scaffold is a ready-to-edit React project (Create React App compatible) using:
- react-router-dom for multi-page routing
- react-slick for carousel (Home page)
- Tailwind CSS (optional; setup instructions included)

Files included:
- package.json (lists dependencies and deploy scripts)
- public/index.html
- public/logo.jpg (your uploaded logo)
- src/ (React source: App.jsx, pages/*, index.js, index.css)
- tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js

Quick start:
1. Ensure Node.js and npm are installed.
2. In the project folder run:
   npm install
3. Start dev server:
   npm start
4. Build for production:
   npm run build
5. Deploy to GitHub Pages:
   - Update 'homepage' in package.json to: https://<your-username>.github.io/cm-shri-school
   - Create a repository named cm-shri-school and push this code to the main branch
   - Run: npm run deploy

Notes:
- Tailwind is included in devDependencies. To enable Tailwind in CRA, ensure PostCSS is configured (postcss.config.js included). If you prefer not to use Tailwind, the site will still work with the fallback CSS in index.css.
- I can convert this scaffold to Vite or a plain Create React App structure if you prefer.

Next steps I can do for you:
- Push this repo to GitHub for you (you'll provide a repo or allow me to create one).
- Replace placeholder sample content with your final content.
- Set up CI/CD with Netlify/Vercel for zero-config deploy.
